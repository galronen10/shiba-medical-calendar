# React Native Client

## üìå Project Overview
This is the **React Native** client for the medical application, built using **Expo** for easy development and deployment. The app leverages **React Native Paper** for UI components, **@react-navigation** for navigation, and **Redux** for state management. Code consistency is ensured using **ESLint** and **Prettier**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (>= 16.x)
- **npm**
- **Expo CLI** (install with `npm install -g expo-cli`)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <project_directory>
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Start the Application
To start the development server, run:
```bash
npm run start
```
This will launch the Expo developer tools, allowing you to run the app on an emulator or a physical device.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Running on a Device
- Install the **Expo Go** app on your Android/iOS device.
- Scan the QR code from the Expo developer tools to launch the app.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Code Formatting and Linting
To maintain code quality, the project uses **ESLint** and **Prettier**.

#### Run ESLint
```bash
npm run lint
```

#### Fix ESLint Issues Automatically
```bash
npm run lint:fix
```

#### Run Prettier
```bash
npm run prettier:write
```
